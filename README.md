A collection of files I'll write while learning the basics of data science, mostly following [this review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823).

### Compiling

First run

    pip install .
    
while in the DataScience-Learning directiory. Then, the chapters can be ran using 

    python src/main.py [arguments]

where [arguments] denotes which chapter should be run. Valid inputs here are 'ch2' and 'ch4-grad'. Note that multiple chapters can be run at the same time.

### Dependencies

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
